## Training Log App
### In progress

Next.js application using React Bootstrap, Postgres SQL, and deployed on Vercel. Is an athlete focused app that digitizes the training log. Less focused on GPS data as many modern platforms and more on providing comprehensive ability to track and record training. Currently working on creating a sign up and login form so that I can get the existing functionality deployed to production!

Worked through the Next.js invoice dashboard app as a pre-cursor. [View app in production](https://nextjs-dashboard-5otfzqkw1-christopher-capps-projects.vercel.app)
