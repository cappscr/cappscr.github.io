I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer on a Data Enablement team, building solutions for FIS's Digital Banking business. My background includes both Product Management and front-end JavaScript engineering, giving me a comprehensive view of the software development lifecycle. I believe in creating efficient, scalable, and user-focused applications. When I'm not coding, you can find me running on the road or trails.
